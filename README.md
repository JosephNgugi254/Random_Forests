# Random_Forests
Random Forest is a type of ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. 
When making a prediction, the Random Forest algorithm aggregates the predictions of all the individual trees in the forest and returns the most common prediction. This approach helps to reduce overfitting and improves the accuracy of the model.
#Using the insuance csv , i performed a predictive analysis folllowing these steps:
step 1: Importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset to begin the EDA.
Step 2: perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
step 3: Training the Models
step 4: Combining the Models
step 5:Evaluating the Ensemble
step 6: Tuning the Ensemble
